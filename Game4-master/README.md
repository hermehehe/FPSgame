This game is designed to be a top-down shooter game where a user-controlled player is attempting to stay alive and shoot down as many zombies as possible. The game takes place in a toxic wasteland where they have been trapped inside a zombie apocalypse. 

Controls: WASD to move, Mouse1/Left Click to shoot 

Scoring: Each zombie kill = +10 pts 

HP: The player initially starts with 50 Health, and every contact the player makes w/ a zombie is a loss of -8 health (this damage increases by +2 per round)

Difficulty: Each round possesses a greater difficulty; the zombies move faster, deal more damage, and come in bigger bunches as the rounds progress. 

Objective: Kill as many zombies as possible for a high score & stay alive for as many rounds as you can! 

See "How to Play" in the Menu Screen for brief details of controls/objective
