Top Down FPS zombie game

Here I worked in a group of 4 back in 2022 to create this zombie FPS game in Java. My contributes where creating and uploading image files to each class, in game GUIs, and minimizing image buffering. My group members Josh and Henry worked on gameplay code, and Widaad worked on the Start Menu GUI.

This was my first time coding with a group. Collaboration was great as we did this project for fun and all played to each others strengths. This project was a good introduction to version control protocol and etiquette (history not available on this git account as I lost access to my previous one).
