Top Down FPS zombie game

Here I worked in a group of 4 back in 2022 to create this zombie FPS game in Java. My contributes where creating and uploading image files to each class, minimizing image buffering, in game GUIS and mouse conneection to player rotation movements. My group members Josh and Henry primarily worked on gameplay, and Widaad worked on the Start Menu GUI.

This was my first time coding with a group. Collaboration was great as we did this project for fun and all played to each others strengths. This project was a good introduction to version control protocol and etiquette (history not available on this git account as I lost access to my previous one).
